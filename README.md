# Gulp imagemin

Image optimization with `Gulp`, `gulp-imagemin`, `gifsicle`, `guetzli`, `optipng` and `svgo`.

I have to optimize a lot of images during the week, so I did this. I hope it can help you too.

## How to

1. Make sure you have `gulp` installed on your computer;
1. Clone or download this repo, then use `npm install` in the root folder to install the dependencies used on this script;
1. Put your images on `input` folder;
1. `gulp images` does the trick. You can also use `gulp gif`, `gulp jpg`, `gulp png` and `gulp svg`.

Note: `guetzli` can be really slow.

## Do you want more?

Take a look on `imagemin` documentation and customize your script!
